The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [24th of January 2021].

## Log

### R1D1 
Today I created a personal access token with the github API and used it to read repo details from my github account. I also used it to read commit details for specific repos. This was relatively easy to achieve, however I still have some questions around how exactly OAuth2 works and what is different between an implementation using a personal access token and OAuth. Feel happy that I sat down and did this today, a good first step towards this challenge. Turns out sitting down and just starting to code does work decently well

### R1D2
Today I created a webhook throught the github UI for my GithubAccountability Repo. I initially set it up so that whenever a comment on a commit is received that an event would be sent to me. I was able to successfully receive the payload and view the data which was sent to me. Tomorrow I plan on extending the functionlaity of this endpoint so that it does something useful when someone pushes to a repo. Likely I will do something like sending a message to telegram or signal etc. This was a good day and I feel like I better grasp the idea of Webhooks now.

### R1D3
Today I connected to the telegram API using a bot. I struggled a bit here in trying to make the bot send me an individual method. But was successful in setting up the connection. Hopefully tomorrow I will be able to get some messages getting sent back and forth. Once that is achieved I will be able to connect up the webhook implementation and send through commit details when the webhook is hit.
