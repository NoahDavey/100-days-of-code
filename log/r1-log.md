### R1D1 
Today I created a personal access token with the github API and used it to read repo details from my github account. I also used it to read commit details for specific repos. This was relatively easy to achieve, however I still have some questions around how exactly OAuth2 works and what is different between an implementation using a personal access token and OAuth. Feel happy that I sat down and did this today, a good first step towards this challenge. Turns out sitting down and just starting to code does work decently well
